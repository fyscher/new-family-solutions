        <p className="a-p">
          My journey began with a deep passion for supporting children with
          disabilities and the families who love them. While earning my Bachelor
          of Community Rehabilitation at the University of Calgary, I discovered
          that this work was more than a career—it was a calling. Through
          hands-on experience, I saw how powerful early and compassionate
          support could be, but I also witnessed how many families struggled to
          access the care their children truly needed. I wanted to do more. I
          wanted to create something personal, respectful, and genuinely
          supportive—not only for the child, but for the entire family. In 2007,
          I took a leap of faith and founded New Family Solutions Inc. so I
          could serve families in a deeper, more meaningful way. What began as a
          small vision has grown into a company built on trust, empathy, and
          dedication. Every child and family we work with reminds me why I
          started. New Family Solutions is not just a business—it is my heart,
          my purpose, and my promise to keep showing up for the families who
          need support the most.
